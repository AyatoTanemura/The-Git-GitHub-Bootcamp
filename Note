# What is Git?
The world's most popular version control system
Version control is software that tracks and manages changes to files over time.
Version control systems generally allow users to revisit earlier versions of the files, compare 
  changes between versions, undo changes, and a whole lot more.

# Git vs GitHub
## Git
Git is the version control software that runs locally on your machine. You don't need to register for an account.
You don't need the internet to use it. You can use Git without ever touching Github.

## GitHub
Github is a service that hosts Git repositories in the cloud and makes it easier to collaborate with other people.
You do need to sign up for an account to use Github. It's an online place to share work that is done using Git.
